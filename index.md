Here are some things I wrote recently. I tackle most subjects out of curiosity, with bonus point if it can be useful to someone. 

[Contact me](mailto:toastedcornflakes@gmail.com) if you find anything interesting, I'm always happy to discuss details.

## AVR microcontroller
* [Barebone](/articles/avr_getting_started.html) AVR programming: a hands-on guide to programming, setting up the IO pins, clocks, and every fun bit

## Fun
* Writing a [JIT compiler](/articles/jit-brainfuck.html) for brainfuck
* How I [reversed](/articles/cysca_portknock.html) a portknock of a capture the flag challenge

## Security
* [Fast, in-process](/articles/fuzzing_capstone_with_afl.html) fuzzing using AFL-fuzz

## Miscellaneous
 * Vector quantization [animation](/articles/vector_quantization/index.html) â€” Visual presentation of different algorithms to group vectors in sets.
